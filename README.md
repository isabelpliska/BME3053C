## Background
The project focuses on efficiently analyzing white blood cell counts in blood smear slides to identify leukocytosis, an elevated count associated with conditions like leukemia. With a dataset of 120 images from Kaggle, the goal is to automate cell type identification using for loops and cell detection methods. This streamlined approach aims to save time for physicians and researchers in diagnosing leukocytosis, crucial in diseases like leukemia. The project's significance lies in its potential to contribute to quicker interventions where time matters, and its scope covers identifying cell types and counts on blood smear slides for broader applicability.
